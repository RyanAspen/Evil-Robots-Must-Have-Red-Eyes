This is the first attempt at a bot for the competition. As of now, soldiers are the name of the game. The strategy right now is
- Produce a random mix of soldiers and moppers
- Soldiers randomly search for enemy towers and ruins and destroy/develop them
- Moppers randomly search and steal paint whenever possible and give extra paint to allies

This is really basic, but its a start.
