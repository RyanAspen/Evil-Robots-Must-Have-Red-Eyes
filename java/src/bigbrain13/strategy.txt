This was implemented a bit in the last version, but now let's add
the ability for each bot to remember some info about where it's been
to add some semblance of macro. Use KnowledgeBase. Make sure bytecode is all
good.

Also, reevaluate bot spawning and the roles of each bot.
- Splashers should be utilized more. In the early game, they're great
tower disruptors. In the mid-to-late game, they are the best robot
for making offensive progress. Because of this, paint towers need to
be prioritized more than they currently are.
    * PRIORITIES
        * Paint over as many contested tiles as possible, and make
        special effort to disrupt towers.
        * Splashers should not attack if they aren't near enemies tiles
        or enemy units.
        * Can be the greediest when it comes to refilling paint.
    * Should be spawned by paint towers whenever possible.
- Moppers are meant to be used primarily to weaken enemy robots. They
should work independently and leech off of enemy units. They can also
halt offensive momentum for enemies by destroying progress.
    * PRIORITIES
        * Go towards large groups of enemies and mop or mop sweep enemies
        * If no enemies are nearby and there are allies nearby, try to
        mop enemy tiles. If an ally is below 20% of their paint capacity,
        try to give paint to them.
        * Should try to stay above 75 paint whenever possible.
    * Should occassionally be spawned by front-line towers to assist
    splashers and soldiers
- Soldiers are essential for building a defensive economic presence,
since they are the only bot capable of consistently creating patterns.
They are also the best at destroying towers. They can paint the most
efficiently, but they aren't especially useful in a robot-vs-robot
fight.
    * PRIORITIES
        * Mark and complete tower patterns
        * Attack enemy towers
        * Attack empty tiles
        * Create SRPs
        * They shouldn't need much paint for refilling
    * Should be the first things spawned by the towers in the early game.
    Each new tower should try to spawn a few of them. After a while, new soldiers
    should be kept at a minimum

Front-line heuristic:
- A tower is considered "front-line" if it has seen enemy units in the last 50 turns.
- Otherwise, it is "back-line".
- "front-line" towers should build more units, especially splashers
- "back-line" towers shouldn't build too many units except a few soldiers
- Once the capability is there, "front-line" towers should mainly be
defense or paint towers. "back-line" towers should mainly be gold towers.

Contested Zone heuristic:
- An area is "contested" if there are enemies nearby.
