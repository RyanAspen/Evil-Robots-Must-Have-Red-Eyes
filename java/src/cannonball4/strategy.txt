Now that there's something relatively stable, let's make it unstable! The focus now will be the implementation of splashers.

Splashers should only be created after the early rounds and when we have a fair amount of paint to spare.

Splashers should focus on efficiently painting new zones.
- Tiles near friendly towers are off limits
- An empty tile is good, an enemy tile is better, and tiles with towers on them are better yet!

Splashers shouldn't attack if the best attack isn't worth the paint spent on it
