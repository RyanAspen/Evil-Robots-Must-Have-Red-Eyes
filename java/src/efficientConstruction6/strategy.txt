The goals of this version are:

- Add towerPatternToComplete, which gives the unitType corresponding to
the pattern centered at the given ruin, or null if none exist
DONE

TODO (Will save for another version)
- Incorporate the above method into Soldier logic


- Update pathfinding to be similar to GoneFishin's 2023 pathfinding code except:
    * SOLDIER
        - If the current tile is an empty tile and we have at least 3 towers,
        wait until we can attack the tile.
        - Treat enemy tiles as walls
    * MOPPER
        - If the current tile is an enemy tile, wait until we can mop the tile
    * SPLASHER
        - Treat non-allied tiles as walls
DONE

DONE
When approaching ruins, use simple pathfinding instead of the fancy version.
