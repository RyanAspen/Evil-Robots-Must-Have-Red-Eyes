Previous attempt at v12 failed. Now the focus is on new tower strats.
This means:
- Each tower has a % chance to try to build a unit, where that chance
is max(100-2r, 100/t), where r is the # of rounds since an enemy was seen
and t is the number of friendly towers on the field.
- A tower can destroy itself IF
    * the pattern to rebuild is already set AND a soldier is nearby AND we have enough gold AND the tower doesn't have much paint and can't regain it
    *
- A tower can try to replace itself as follows:
    * When certain conditions are met, the tower sends a message to
    a soldier to re-mark the tower with the desired pattern.
    * Once the new pattern is ready, destroy the old tower.
- A defense tower replaces itself if it hasn't seen an enemy in at
least 100 rounds
- A gold tower replaces itself if we have at least 20 towers already

Things learned from scrimmages:
- Splasher rushes are very good at stalling enemies
- Moppers should always try to mop and they shouldn't move if they are
already within mopping range.
- Soldiers should create a path before taking it.
- Temporarily move to safety function should be added to move to the
lowest paint loss area.
- Soldiers in the early stages of the game will often destroy themselves
attempting to complete a tower pattern when they can go back to their spawns
to get paint. Figure out retreat code (are paint towers necessary? there's usually some paint in the spawn towers)
