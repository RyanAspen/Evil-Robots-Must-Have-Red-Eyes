Balance patches for Sprint 1 just came out. Major notes:
- Comms got much better. Look into this asap.
- Clustering is really dangerous now (update micro and pathfinding)
- Mop swinging is now much better (again, update micro)
- Defense towers are buffed (already kind of accounted for this, but check anyway)
- SRP should be overhauled (current code is functional, but idk)

There's too much to go over now, so this update will be focused on redoing micro
to account for clustering changes, incorporating mop swinging, and changing pathfinding
to account for clustering.

Note:
Because bytecode is becoming a problem, try to optimize bytecode more and specify more constants for maximum bytecode
allocation for micro and other methods.
