work as follows:

https://github.com/battlecode/battlecode25-lectureplayer/blob/main/java/src/lectureplayer/RobotPlayer.java
Standard Bug Nav 2 with the following additions:
* ROBOT_WALL percent chance to treat robots as walls
* aggro boolean. If true,
    - Paint is not considered a wall in any case (overrides other rules)
* careful boolean. If true,
    - treat enemy paint as walls if there's an adjacent non-enemy tile to us
    - treat neutral paint as walls if there's an adjacent allied tile to us
* Extra rules per bot type
    - SOLDIER
        * Treat enemy paint as walls
        * If the next tile is neutral, paint it or wait to paint it
    - MOPPER
        * If the next tile is enemy, mop it or wait to mop it
    - SPLASHER
        * careful = true
