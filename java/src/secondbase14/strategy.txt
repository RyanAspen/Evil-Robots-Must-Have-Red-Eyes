Ideally, this is the last version before the Sprint 2 deadline. The
changes for this version are as follows:
- Towers should try to spawn a mopper if they see enemy paint (DONE)
- Fix soldier micro against towers to be simpler and more aggro towards
towers. (DONE)
- Have some soldiers explicitly seek out and destroy enemy towers
(ignore movement micro entirely) (Ignoring for now)
- Increase probability of paint towers after first few rounds
- Make splasher movement micro more aggressive (more willing to enter
enemy territory)
- Improve SRP creation (4x4, move to complete SRPs more aggressively,
allocate more resources towards SRPs)
