This version is meant to account for rush strategies that could be common for the Sprint 1 tournament and on easier maps.

The counter strategy is as follows:
- Each tower spawns a soldier ASAP
- The soldier starts by marking its spawn tower with the correct pattern.
- When an enemy is seen by a starting tower, spawn a mopper as close as possible to the enemy as well as a soldier.
- The existing code should do the rest (pressure the attackers as much as possible and rebuild towers destroyed by the aggressors)
