Now that we have basics down, this version will focus on communication. Bots will communicate info to towers and vice versa. These are
the message types for now:
- PaintRequest
    * Sent by a bot if it is low on paint or by a tower if it knows a near bot is low on paint
    * OpCode = 0
    * Fields: ID that needs paint
- DroughtSignal
    * Sent by a tower if it detects many PaintRequest messages
    * OpCode = 1
    * Fields: None
- PossibleTowerLocSignal
    * Sent by a tower if it thinks an enemy tower is at a particular location (symmetry)
    * OpCode = 2
    * Fields: Tower location
- ConfirmedTowerLocSignal
    * Sent by a tower if it knows an enemy tower is at a particular location or by a bot if it knows an enemy tower is at a particular location
    * OpCode = 3
    * Fields: Tower location
- FloodSignal
    * Sent by a tower if all of the bots nearby have a lot of paint
    * OpCode = 4
    * Fields: None
- RuinLocSignal
    * Sent by a tower or bot if it knows a ruins location
    * OpCode = 5
